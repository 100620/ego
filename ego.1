.BR ego
modules are designed to be stand-alone commands as well. It allows you to use shortcuts to access these sub-commands.

.B ego profile.
.SH MODULES
.TP
.B profile
Manage Funtoo Linux profiles like: arch, build, subarch, flavor and mix-ins.  Module shortcut is:
.BR epro

Running it without any arguments will get you an overview of your current profile settings.

To specify an arch, build, subarch or flavor just use it like:
.IP
.B ego profile
.I profile
.I desired-selection
.PP
.IP
For example, to set your architecture to pure64 use:
.IP
.B epro arch pure64
.IP

Since you can have several mix-ins enabled, you can specify more than one option when changing your mix-ins. Use the plus sign, or none sign at all, to add a mix-in and the minus sign to remove it.
.IP
To deselect the kde and cinnamon mix-ins and enable the gnome one instead type:
.IP
.B epro mix-ins -kde -cinnamon +gnome
