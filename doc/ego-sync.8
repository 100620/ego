.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBego sync [\-h] [\-\-kits\-only|\-\-meta\-repo\-only|\-\-in\-place|\-\-config\-only] [\-\-dest DESTINATION]\fP
.SH USAGE
.sp
Use the \fBego sync\fP command to perform an initial clone of meta\-repo, or to update meta\-repo according to the settings
in \fB/etc/ego.conf\fP See ego.conf(5) for information on how to configure \fBego sync\fP\&.
.sp
\fBego sync\fP is typically run as the root user, but can also be run as a regular user. When run as a root user, the
code will look at the user and group ownership of the meta\-repo directory if it exists and will \(aqdrop permissions\(aq
to run the sync operations as this user. If meta\-repo does not yet exist, it will perform the sync operations as the
\fBportage\fP user and the \fBportage\fP group.
.sp
When run as a regular user, \fBego sync\fP will of course not drop permissions, but will perform sync operations as
the current user and the current user\(aqs primary group.
.sp
\fBego sync\fP, when run as root, will run \fBemerge sync\fP in order to sync any non\-Funtoo kits, and this will also
trigger any \(aqpackage move updates\(aq (renames) that need to be applied to the package database in \fB/var/db/pkg\fP\&.
When run as a regular user, these steps are skipped.
.SS Syncing Kits Only
.sp
Use the \fB\-\-kits\-only\fP option to tell ego to only sync the kits themselves, and not update meta\-repo.
.SS Syncing Meta\-Repo Only
.sp
Use the \fB\-\-meta\-repo\-only\fP option to tell ego to only sync meta\-repo, and not update or clone any kits.
.SS Syncing In\-Place
.sp
Use the \fB\-\-in\-place\fP option to tell ego to not perform any syncing, but to check out the correct kits according
to \fB/etc/ego.conf\fP kit and release settings, update \fB/etc/portage/repos.conf\fP, and update the active profiles
accordingly. This is useful in conjunction when doing development and using Funtoo\(aqs merge\-all\-kits script to
generate your own local meta\-repo. After this is done, moving to symlinking it to \fB/var/git/meta\-repo\fP and running
\fBego sync \-\-in\-place\fP will ensure that the correct kit branches are checked out and that meta\-repo is ready to use.
You must run \fBego sync \-\-in\-place\fP as root since it must modify files in \fB/etc/portage\fP\&.
.SS Updating Config Only
.sp
The \fB\-\-config\-only\fP option will instruct ego to not change the current kit branches that are checked out at all,
so \fBmeta\-repo\fP will not be touched, but the configuration in \fB/etc/portage\fP will be updated to reflect the current
state of \fBmeta\-repo\fP\&. This is different than \fB\-\-in\-place\fP as what is in \fB/etc/ego.conf\fP is not consulted and
the files in \fB/etc/portage\fP are set up to use the \fBmeta\-repo\fP as it currently exists on disk. This is used by
\fBmetro\fP when building stages. When a meta\-repo snapshot is extracted, \fBego sync \-\-kits\-only\fP is run to grab the
kit repos, and then \fBego sync \-\-config\-only\fP is run to update the files in \fB/etc/portage\fP to use this extracted
meta\-repo.
.SS Creating a Meta\-Repo For Archiving
.sp
The \fB\-\-dest\fP option can be used to manually specify the location to point to a new location to create
a meta\-repo. This setting overrides the \fBmeta_repo_path\fP and \fBkits_path\fP settings in \fB/etc/ego.conf\fP, and also
turns off automatic regeneration of repository configuration in \fB/etc/portage/repos.conf\fP, as well as updates to
profile settings. This functionality is useful for creating a meta\-repo for archiving purposes.
